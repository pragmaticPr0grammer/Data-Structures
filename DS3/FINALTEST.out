Running tests for sequence class with a dynamic array

START OF TEST 1:
Testing insert, attach, and the constant member functions (4 points).
Starting with an empty sequence.
Testing that size() returns 0 ... Passed.
Testing that is_item() returns false ... Passed.
I'll call start() and look at the items one more time...
All tests passed for this sequence.

I am now using attach to put 10 into an empty sequence.
Testing that size() returns 1 ... Failed.
Basic test of size() or is_item() failed.

Test 1 failed.
END OF TEST 1.


START OF TEST 2:
Testing situations where the cursor goes off the sequence (4 points).
Using attach to put 20 and 30 in the sequence, and then calling
advance, so that is_item should return false ... failed.
Test 2 failed.
END OF TEST 2.


START OF TEST 3:
Testing remove_current (4 points).
Using attach to build a sequence with 10,30.
Insert a 20 before the 30, so entire sequence is 10,20,30.
Testing that size() returns 3 ... Failed.
Basic test of size() or is_item() failed.

Test 3 failed.
END OF TEST 3.


START OF TEST 4:
Testing the resize member function (2 points).
I will now resize a sequence to a larger capacity, and then
attach that many items. The sequence should NOT need to
resize itself under this situation.
    sequence does not contain correct items.
Test 4 failed.
END OF TEST 4.


START OF TEST 5:
Testing the copy constructor (2 points).
Copy constructor test: for an empty sequence.
Testing that size() returns 0 ... Passed.
Testing that is_item() returns false ... Passed.
I'll call start() and look at the items one more time...
All tests passed for this sequence.

Copy constructor test: for a sequence with cursor at tail.
Testing that size() returns 60 ... Failed.
Basic test of size() or is_item() failed.

Test 5 failed.
END OF TEST 5.


START OF TEST 6:
Testing the assignment operator (2 points).
Assignment operator test: for an empty sequence.
Testing that size() returns 0 ... Passed.
Testing that is_item() returns false ... Passed.
I'll call start() and look at the items one more time...
All tests passed for this sequence.

Assignment operator test: for a sequence with cursor at tail.
Testing that size() returns 60 ... Failed.
Basic test of size() or is_item() failed.

Test 6 failed.
END OF TEST 6.


START OF TEST 7:
Testing insert/attach when current DEFAULT_CAPACITY exceeded (3 points).
Testing to see that attach works correctly when the
current capacity is exceeded.
Testing that size() returns 60 ... Failed.
Basic test of size() or is_item() failed.

Test 7 failed.
END OF TEST 7.
